Posts a random image from a local folder to Twitter.

# USAGE
	python bot.py "path_to_image_folder" "image_filenames_to_exclude"

e.g. python bot.py "./images/" "PXL_"

All images from "./images/" can be chosen but images beginning with "PXL_" will not have their filename appended to the tweet as text.
